My name is Erik Sandoval,

3 words I would use to describe myself would curious, studious, and passionate. My hobbies include, researching the newest gadgets on the market, and playing video games. My main games are Rainbow Six Siege and Runescape. My favorite Animals are dogs, because they are so affectionate and goofballs without even trying!
